## Control Structure:
The main control structure used to make out Romi Line Follower was a cascading controller, where longitudinal velocity and yaw rate are used to set motor speeds. These motor speeds then have their own control loops. Each control loop was done with PID controllers. Gains ranged from 0 to 3. The image below describes the structure well.
